A university project of 4 people.

Web-based video annotation tool. It is inteded for ENT-doctor (Ear, Nose, Throat) use. A short video would be uploaded and doctor would annotate polyps or other annomalies.

A Machine Learning pipeline is planned to be integrated. Then the model would annotate the video and give its predictions which would be checked by the doctor.
